Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Upgrade existing system?
 It looks like you've configured MPlayer already. If you'd like to
 configure it with this program, the old configuration
 /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf will be deleted.  Do you want to continue
 configuration with this program?  If you say "Yes", your old
 configuration will be deleted and you can create it anew with this
 program.  If you say "No" your existing files will be kept.  If you
 change your mind later, you can run 'dpkg-reconfigure mplayer'.
